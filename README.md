# Deicision-Tree-Classifier---Task-6

(1). Loaded the iris dataset.
(2). Created a Dataframe consisting of all the features and appended the target classes corresponding to the listed features.
(3). Generated Visualizations to get an insight into the relationships between the given features.
(4). Generated the "predictor" dataset" consisting of all the features, also known as predictors; and the "target" consisting of the target classes.
(5). Performed a Train-Test split in the ratio (70% to 30%) for the training and testing data, respectively.
(6). Initialized a parameter grid - 'param_grid' dictionary, consisting of hyperparameters as keys and their possible set of values in the form of a list as values to the keys.
(7). Generated a model corresponding to every possible combination of hyperparameters, also generated a visualization of the Decision Tree thus obtained.
(8). Selected the best_params to train a new model, also know as the 'best_model', which happens to be generating an accuracy of 0.971.
(9). Generated the results in the form of a 'confusion matrix', a 'classification report', and the 'Decision Tree' obtained from the 'best model'.
